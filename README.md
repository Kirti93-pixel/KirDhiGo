The repository contains the optimized Solutions (written in Golang) for various Computer Science and Data Structure &amp; Algorithmic Problems.

Any file can run directly in any Go installed system.
E.g.,

`go run .\others\Valid_Parenthesis.go`
`go run .\trees\BST.go`

WIP for more Solutions, Happy Coding :)
